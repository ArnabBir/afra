## Afra: crowdsourcing gene feature annotation

Genomes of emerging model organisms are now being sequenced at [low cost](http://www.genome.gov/images/content/cost_genome.jpg).
However, obtaining accurate gene predictions remains challenging.  Even the
best gene prediction algorithms make substantial errors, leading to further
erroneous analysis. Therefore, many predicted genes need to be visually
inspected and manually curated ([Yandell & Ence](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v13/n5/full/nrg3174.html)); this can be infeasible when working with thousands of genes from multiple organisms.

Inspired by crowdsourcing approaches and platforms including
[Foldit](http://fold.it/), [Galaxy Zoo](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and
[Crowdflower](http://www.crowdflower.com/), we are developing Afra to recruit
additional gene feature curators.  This should help dramatically increase
the quality of gene curations available for newly sequenced genomes. In the
long-term we aim to recruit contributors among members of the general public.
However, gene curation requires large amounts of specialist knowledge and
overcoming a steep learning curve. While we are working to reduce the steepness
of the learning curve via interactive tutorials and support forums, genome
curation is not yet easily accessible to all. Thus in a first instance we are
recruiting curators among biology students. They perform curations as part of
their courses aiming to understand gene structure and/or challenges with gene
identification and gene prediction.

### Current status

Users login to their dashboard using their Facebook account, where they are
presented with documentation, guided tutorial exercises, and curation challenges which include "Curate" buttons.
Each curation challenge invites user to contribute towards a different curation project.

Clicking 'Curate' sends the user to a JBrowse-derived WebApollo-like curation interface
focusing on a single gene model and showing all available tracks of
evidence for this gene model. The user starts by dragging one of these
models (typically the consensus gene model) to the edit track and can
then edit this gene model.

Users may refer to the tutorials or seek help on our forum using the 'Help &
Support' link at the top. A simple step by step guideline to curation is always
available in a sidebar that folds to the right.

#### Behind the scenes

Afra imports a GFF file of predicted gene models and creates a prioritized list of "curation tasks"
based on expected curation difficulty; the administrator can additionally prioritize specific genes
for a specific curation project. Each gene prediction is presented to four
independent users/curators. Each curator independently examines the gene model
and may propose revisions or add comments (e.g., if there is insufficient
evidence to curate).

For each gene prediction, submitted gene models are then automatically compared:
if all users propose the same changes to a gene model, these changes are
considered to be correct. If gene models proposed by different curators
disagree, the different gene predictions are shown to several more experience
curators who submit their curation in turn. If gene models proposed by the more
experienced curators disagree, all predictions are shown to an even more senior
curator who makes a final verdict.

### Roadmap

![at work](www/img/readme/at-work.png)

* ~~Annotation editing.~~
* ~~Prioritized redundant task distribution~~
* ~~Basic user dashboard.~~
* ~~Simple, non-interactive tutorials.~~

* December 2014: Genome dashboard: Overview of contributions per genome. How many curations. How many pass auto-check.
* December 2014: Comments on curations.
* December 2014: Improve annotation editing experience. Make it more intuitive.
* December 2014: Extensive automated testing of annotation editing functionality.
* December 2014: Improve page load times. Improve annotation editing performance.
* January 2014: Interactive tutorial.
* Spring 2015: Roll out to 200 first year students learning about gene
  structure ... and the inadequacies of Bioinformatics algorithms.

### Contributions are welcome

We welcome contributions of code, curations, or documentation. Find us on
